# RPG_game_threads

This is my first large-scale project.

The goal is to create a **text-based RPG that runs in the terminal**, developed on **GNU/Linux**.  
The main focus of this project is **practicing concurrency using threads**.

This game could be implemented without threads much more easily, but using them is intentional — the purpose is to study **multithreading in practice**, including synchronization and shared resources.

## Purpose

- Learn and practice concurrency with threads
- Apply system-level programming concepts
- Experiment and learn through a non-trivial project

## About

- Text-based RPG
- Runs in the terminal
- Gameplay and structure may change over time

## Tech

- Language: **C**
- Platform: **GNU/Linux**
- Focus: Threads and concurrency

## Status

This project is a work in progress.  
The code will be updated and improved as I learn more.
